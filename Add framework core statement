# AI Direction Framework

AI is smart; it just hasn't been given the right direction.
My framework works like the VLOOKUP function—finding the correct answer instantly, just like in a spreadsheet.

This framework solves the core pain of the entire AI industry:
- No more endless conditional logic written by humans
- AI executes efficiently within a defined, reliable boundary
- Avoids the chaos of unguided AGI
